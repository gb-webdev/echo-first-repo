#Intro to Github

## Echo's first github extravaganza

- more content, I like crepes, they might be the best breakfast food (well sweet breakfast food that is)

I also like climbing, but I haven't done it in a whiel because I injured myself. I'm excited to go back :D

I don't know what to write, I asked my cohort peers, Bao also said the same thing, so we're just writing "garbage"

4th commit, continuing repetition to lock this in my mind
