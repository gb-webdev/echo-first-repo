#Intro to Github

## Echo's first github extravaganza

- more content, I like crepes, they might be the best breakfast food (well sweet breakfast food that is)

I also like climbing, but I haven't done it in a whiel because I injured myself. I'm excited to go back :D

I don't know what to write, I asked my cohort peers, Bao also said the same thing, so we're just writing "garbage"

4th commit, continuing repetition to lock this in my mind

Will put on Steven universe lofi, it's soothing and relaxing, I'm unsure if it is a distraction or helping in the repetition and learning.

Coaches checking in, everybody reported that they're doing well which is good to hear.
